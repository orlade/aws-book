# Objectives

The purpose of this book is to teach you the fundamental skills required to **deploy a Web application to the AWS cloud**, to make the Web as accessible as possible to aspiring developers.

## Why do this?

Web technologies are advancing at a ludicrous speed. Given a laptop, an Internet connection and basic programming skills, anybody can build an app and deploy it to the cloud *at zero cost*. There are literally billions of potential users at your fingertips.

Programming is getting increasingly abstract, making code easier to write. However the process of deploying that code can still be somewhat mystifying. There are many vendors, many processes, many pricing tiers and many tradeoffs. It's hard to get started and be confident in your decisions.

If this process were less complicated, perhaps even *simple*, there would be more developers more able to accomplish their dreams. There would be more apps, more services, and **more time spent on solving more interesting problems**.

## Who is this for?

Any developer interested in learning about deployment on AWS. You may have the most rudimentary programming knowledge, or be a specialist who hasn't dabbled in operations, or have experimented with AWS before and simply bounced off.

This book walks through each of the fundamental concepts and tools with as little fluff as possible, and a "fast lane" at the end of each section.

Regardless of your skill level, you can punch through each step of the book in under an hour. Alternatively, take it slow and follow the links to the background reading on the topics that resonate with you. Consider it equal parts guide and reference.

## Why you?

I'm passionate about software engineering, in particular Web apps and [full-stack development][full]. I've been through three university degrees, two companies, one startup as technical co-founder, and thousands of books and blogs. It has been a hell of a lot of fun, and I'm just getting started.

Some things can only be learned through experience. For everything else, we draw on the experience of others. I'm no guru, but I've learned enough to suspect that my experience might be helpful to others, maybe even you.

Everybody is searching for a legacy. Maybe I'll end up building the next Google and retire having left my mark on the world... but I know that would require as much luck as skill. On the other hand, no matter what happens, I can always teach and maybe even inspire the next Larry Page instead.

And the best part is they're not mutually exclusive. *¿Por qué no los dos?*
